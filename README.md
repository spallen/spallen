## About

I build clean, reliable, and scalable front-end systems with a focus on clarity, performance, and maintainability. My background in art direction and design informs how I approach engineering—thoughtful interaction, clear visual structure, and code that feels intentional.

Over the past decade, I’ve worked with digital agencies, startups, and enterprise teams across technology, healthcare, financial, and creative industries. I specialize in component architectures, design systems, and high-traffic interfaces that require strong engineering judgment and attention to detail.

I use AI-assisted tools the same way I use any other part of the stack: to speed up work that should be faster, while keeping core decisions grounded in experience and practical problem-solving.
